These are all hobby projects that either failed, or got potential, but was never fully developed.
Most of these projects are made in Unity, so there are alot of "irrellevant" files if you're only interested in the code. to see the code go to the .cs files.
For the scripts there are a ".cs" AND a ".cs.meta" file, but you can ignore the meta file.

I have gone trough and cleaned some "Silly" comments, apologies if I've missed some. These projects were not made with the public EYE in mind.
